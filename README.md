Asset Labs is an application that allows the user to manage their assets in a simple and user friendly way. The user can scan QR codes for items and add them without needing to manually type any item information. The user can also add manually, delete, edit, and search for items. The user dashboard gives a quick preview on how many assets this user has stored in their inventory. This application also requires email verification upon registration and upon changing passwords.
